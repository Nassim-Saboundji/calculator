# calculator

Assuming you have nodejs install you need to do the following to run the project :
- run npm install
- node server.js

Visit localhost:3000 to use the app.

I have deployed it at the following url : https://calculator-xcy0.onrender.com/ (May be slow due to using the free tier of render.com)
